# Extend the given code (in the exercise area) so the code capitalizes all the
# names and surnames of the list and then prints the new list.
# The output of your code should be as below:
# ['John Smith', 'Jay Santi', 'Eva Kuki']

# Solution:
# names = ["john smith", "jay santi", "eva kuki"]
# capital_names = []
# for i in names:
#     capital_names.append(i.title())
# print(capital_names)


# Extend the given code so the code prints out a list containing
# the number of characters for each username.
# The output of your code should be as below:
# [9, 11, 11]

# Solution:
# usernames = ["john 1990", "alberta1970", "magnola2000"]
# char_count = []
# for i in usernames:
#     char_count.append(len(i))
# print(char_count)


# Extend the given code so the code prints out a list
# containing the same items as floats.
# The output of your code should be as below:
# [10.0, 19.1, 20.0]

# Solution:
# user_entries = ['10', '19.1', '20']
# floats = []
# for i in user_entries:
#     floats.append(float(i))
# print(floats)


# Extend the given code so it prints out the sum of the numbers.
# The output of your code should be as below:
# 49.1

# Solution:
# user_entries = ['10', '19.1', '20']
# total = []
# for i in user_entries:
#     total.append(float(i))
# print(sum(total))
