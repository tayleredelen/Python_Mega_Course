# Create a program that:
# 1. Prompts the user to input a (dollar) amount.
# 2. Calculates the corresponding amount in euros, given an exchange rate of 2.
# 3. Prints out the amount in euros.

# Solution:
# rate = 2
# prompt = input("Enter a dollar amount: ")
# number = float(prompt)
# print(number * rate)


# The ranking list given in the coding area represents the ranking of three athletes, John, Sen, and Lisa.
# John won 1st place, Sen got 2nd, and Lisa 3rd.
# Your task is to create a program that:
# 1. Contains the above list.
# 2. Prompts the user to input a rank number.
# 3. Returns the person who has the given rank.

# Solution:
# ranking = ['John', 'Sen', 'Lisa']
# rank = int(input("Enter rank number: "))
# index = rank - 1
# print(ranking[index])


# We have defined the same ranking list as in the previous exercise:
# This time you should create a program that:
# 1. Contains the above list.
# 2 Prompts the user to input the person's name.
# 3. Returns the rank that person has.

# Solution:
# ranking = ['John', 'Sen', 'Lisa']
# name = input("Enter a name: ")
# index = ranking.index(name) + 1
# print(int(index))

# Create three variables mood, strength, and rank and assign a
# string to mood, a float to strength, and an integer to rank.
# The values you assign can be anything as long as
# they are of the correct type.

# Solution:
# mood = "happy"
# strength = 3.14
# rank = 1


# Create a color_codes variable and assign a tuple to it.
# The tuple should contain three tuples as items.
# The three tuples can contain any type of data inside them.
# In other words, your variable should be equal to a tuple of tuple of three items each.

# Solution:
# color_codes = ((1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,5))


# Complete the script so that it prints out the 3rd item of list serials.

# # Solution:
# serials = ["RH80810A", "AA899819A", "XYSA9099400", "OOP8988459", "EEO8904882", "KOC9889482"]
# print(serials[2])


# Append the value of current to the end of the list seconds
# Please use the list.append() method to accomplish that.

# Solution:
# seconds = [1.23, 1.45, 1.02]
# current = 1.11
# print(seconds.append(current))
